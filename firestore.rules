/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership and role-based model.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The default posture is deny-all. Access is granted explicitly.
 * - User Profiles (/users): Only the owner can read/write their own profile. An admin/official can read/write any profile.
 * - User Listing (/users): Only users with an 'admin' or 'official' role can list all users.
 * - Content (/content): Any authenticated user can create/read. Only the author can update/delete.
